# credit-risk-classification
Background:
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The data and credit_risk_classification jupyter notebook can be found in the Credit_Risk folder.  The final report gives an overview and quick run down of each learning model (healthy loan, high-risk loan).  Finally a summary of findings.
